After your water has reached boiling point, you want to add it to your espresso shot.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
So remember the ratio is from 1:1 to 1:3.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
And for this video, I'm going to put an amount that's between 1:1 and 1:2

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
in order to fill my cup up.

00:18.000 --> 00:30.000

I poured it from the side because I wanted to preserve my beautiful crema.

00:38.000 --> 00:52.000

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Cheers!
